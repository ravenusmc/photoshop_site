            To start, I should say that I once despised using Photoshop. I had to take not one, but two classes of it at Gwinnett Technical College for my web development degree. I once thought that those classes could have been better used learning how to program. However, about halfway through the second class, something started to happen. I found that I really enjoyed photoshop! I love repairing old photo's, adding color to them and even creating my own fantasy / science fiction scenes. Now before checking out learn a little bit more about me...

          <p class='second_paragraph_about_me'>
           In a past life, I was an intelligence officer and before that an officer in the Marine Corps. I spent most of the 2000's, after college, on deployments to the Middle East. However, before all that, in the late 90's, when I was in high school, I loved technology. I was part of the U.S. FIRST Robotics team. My friends and I were known as the nerds of our high school class. I would spend my Friday evenings not partying or hanging out at a friend's house. Instead, I checked out documentaries on physics from David Goodstein who teaches at CalTech. In my Senior of high school I started to do some programming and made a basic text-based adventure. The screen changed color at certain times and I even had the computer beeping at specific moments! However, when I went to the University of California at Davis, I became a History and Political Science double major. I figured that I would make a career in the Marine Corps and a History degree would serve me well. In late 2013 I was watching some videos on Khan Academy about history which I loved to do. On this particular day, the site mentioned that they had some computer programming videos. I decided to check them out and for some reason, I clicked on one about Python. I slowly started to learn about Python and then in the spring of 2015 took a coding boot camp at Tech Talent South. From there, my knowledge and passion for the art has exploded.

            Finally, I'm constantly working to improve my Photoshop skills. Thus, as you see the work on this site, please know that I'm still a beginner. So...go easy on me!
